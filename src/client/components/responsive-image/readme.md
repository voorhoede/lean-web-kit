# Responsive image

## Features

- Uses a **responsive image strategy**, so the optimal size is loaded.
- Has a **fixed ratio**, so space is reserved before the image is loaded.
- Supports an optional **image caption**.
- Uses **lowest acceptable quality**, so images load as quickly as possible.
- **Supports WebP**, so images have an even smaller filesize in supporting browsers.
- **Lazy loads**, so images only load just before they come into view.
- Has a **broken image styling**, used in case an image can not be loaded at all.

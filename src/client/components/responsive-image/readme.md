# Responsive image

## Features

- Works out-of-the-box with [**DatoCMS image file field**](https://www.datocms.com/docs/other/fields/#file-fields).
- Uses a **responsive image strategy**, that only loads the optimal sized file. For example, high-resolution images will be replaced with a smaller version on mobile devices.
- Has a **fixed ratio**, so space is reserved before the image is loaded. This prevents annoying layout jumps.
- Supports an optional **image caption**.
- Uses **lowest acceptable quality**, so images load as quickly as possible while preventing quality loss.
- **Supports WebP**, a new, modern, image file type with the lowest possible file size.
- **Lazy loads** images, meaning files will only be downloaded when necessary, resulting in much faster page loads.
- Has [**broken image styling**](https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/), used in case an image can not be loaded or does not exist.

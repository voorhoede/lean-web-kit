# Responsive video

## Features

- Supports both **Vimeo** and **YouTube**.
- Has a **fixed ratio**, so space is reserved before the video is loaded. This prevents annoying layout jumps.
- Supports an optional **video caption**.
- Has a **cover image** that lazy loads, meaning the image will only be downloaded when necessary, resulting in much faster page loads.
- Tracks how many people play each video.
- Supports autoplay.

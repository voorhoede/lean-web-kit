# Lean Web Kit

**Lean Web Kit to kick-start your web project.**

The Lean Web Kit is a universal [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app made with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). The app is connected to a hosted headless CMS called [Dato CMS](https://www.datocms.com/). The app is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is configured to use [Netlify cloud functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) to connect back-end services.

To use it for your project, [download a copy](https://github.com/voorhoede/lean-web-kit/archive/master.zip) or run `npx degit voorhoede/lean-web-kit` using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

## Development

### Getting started

Read our complete [getting started guide](https://leanwebkit.voorhoede.nl/en/getting-started/) here. This guide will help you with the CMS setup, cloning the repository and deploying your project using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). In case all you need is a copy of the repository, proceed by following the steps below.

* Clone the repository.
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the environment variables. Copy them from the [Netlify build configuration](https://app.netlify.com/sites/leanwebkit/settings/deploys#build-environment-variables) or ask your tech lead. 
* Run app in development mode (`npm run dev`), see [scripts](#scripts).
* Changes on master and content publishing from the CMS trigger a new build and deploy to the [live environment](http://leanwebkit.voorhoede.nl).

# Support

`index.js` is processed and loaded automatically before your test files.
This is a great place to put global configuration and behavior that modifies Cypress.

## Commands

> Cypress comes with its own API for creating custom commands and overwriting existing commands.

`commands.js` should be used to create custom commands and overwrite existing commands.
